In their report, ISF has used a new method. Companies that make contributions to occupational pensions for their employees, and self-employed individuals who make contributions to their own occupational pensions, pay a “special payroll tax on pension costs” for these contributions. Statistics Sweden’s database FRIDA (Business Register and Individual Database) contains tax return data showing who has paid this tax. Our method uses this information to identify which companies have made contributions to occupational pensions. Data from FRIDA is then linked, via the company’s organizational number, to individual-level data in LISA (Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies). In this way, we can study the coverage of occupational pensions in different groups of employed persons.
